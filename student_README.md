## Contributing to Truck Tracker
In order to contribute to Truck Tracker as a member of our crowd, there are two options for tasks you can complete:
going to food trucks and taking pictures of their menu, or transcribing pictures of menus on Mechanical Turk.

### Going to food trucks
We need people to go to food trucks in the area and take pictures of their menus to help populate our database of trucks. In order to do this, the first step is simply to go to any food truck.
It could be one of your favorites, but preferably also go to some trucks you don't frequent as often so we can get as comprehensive a database as possible.
Once you are at the truck, take pictures of the menu (it can be one or more, whatever makes the most sense, just make sure they're readable. 
Upload them to [this form](https://form.jotform.co/91076064363860). Make sure you have location services enabled when you do so,
as the form also collects your location when you submit the form in addition to the images you will upload. If the default
location seems way off from where the truck actually is, feel free to edit that field, but as long as it's close it should be ok.
Once you've submitted the form, you are done! That's all we need for this task.

### Transcribing menus
For this task we have a [HIT on MTurk sandbox](https://workersandbox.mturk.com/projects/35DGDVUOHKTRNY85GOQXERTIABCYPJ/tasks?ref=w_pl_prvw).
To complete the HIT, you will be displayed a picture of a food truck menu simply record every item on the menu as well as its price and 
fill out as many fields as there are menu items visible. This will allow us to add the food truck's menu and pricing to our website.

### Using Truck Tracker
All of the data we collect will be aggregated and displayed on [this website](158.130.178.72:8080). 
You need to be connected to AirPennNet in order to view the website for now, but on that site should be another link to the form
as well as a map with markers for all of the trucks we have data for so far as well as menu info and prices for those trucks.
